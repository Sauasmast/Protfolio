  December 1996 god gifted me as the first child of the Dahal family. Since I was gifted as 
the eldest child of the family they named me Saugat meaning gift. I am the eldest child of the family on whom has a lot of expectation and whole burden of the family. 
I was raised in the capital city of the Nepal. Despite of low income and living condition of my family, my father and mother always fulfilled my desire and needs.
They brought up me like a prince. I was admitted in the private school when I was two years old. My father worked day and night to give a good education and fulfill
my every needs. I still remember the days when my father used to buy me and my brother new clothes without buying him a single pair of shoe to replace the torn out 
shoe. I made my father and mother proud with continuous good grades on my school. On 2012 I passed my S.L.C examination with 88%. I was the second topper of my school.
The day when the result came out I saw the true happiness in my father and mother's face. From that day on I pledge myself to never let them down and keep on working hard 
to keep them proud and happy. <br>
On 2012, I joined the Everest Florida Higher Secondary School to continue my high school. With the aim to became a computer engineer I started to pursue my studies on 
science. I was totally dedicated on my studies and got good grades on my high school as well. I passed my high school with 83.3% on aggregate. After that came the most 
crucial period in my life. I was totally confused about my future. I wanted to study computer engineering but bachelor's program of Nepal was not too good and even after
you graduate you might end up with not having a job. So, I decided to go abroad to continue my studies. <br>
On, 2015 August 24 at 4:00pm approximately I ended up landing on the land where dreams come true (U.S) to pursue my futher studies. I am an international student in 
Caldwell University with the lot of expectation and great dreams. The real journey of life started once I landed in this country. I want to be great one day. I just want
to see my mother and father happy because of me. I am trying my best to keep good gardes and study hard. I wish to give my father and mother all the happiness that they
deserve in their life. I want to keep them happy all the time. I would always try my best to give my best effort despite of what happens in future. I will always work hard 
and never give up. I will make my mother and father proud one day. All I want in my life is happiness of my mother and father.
